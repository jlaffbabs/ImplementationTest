# ImplementationTest

## Purpose
The aim of this implementation is to receive data regarding business opportunities in JSON format and use methods from the Slack API to automatically post these to the relevant channel in Slack. These messages will be posted in a more legible format and will be sent to the appropriate #sales channel depending on the "country" tag in the JSON post request.
